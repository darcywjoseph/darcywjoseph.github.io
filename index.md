Hi! I am a fifth-year undergraduate student at the University of Adelaide (Australia) pursuing a **B.Eng (Hons) in Electrical + Electronic** Engineering and a **BMaCompSci. in Computer Science**. I have previously held undergraduate research positions, including at the Terahertz Engineering Lab under Dr. Withawat Withayachumnankul. I am currently a **Machine Learning Intern** at Swordfish Computing working on **3D synthetic data generation** for computer vision models.<br/>My primary research interests surround **Computer Vision** and **Machine Learning**, particularly their applications in **Robotics** and **Autonomous Systems**.
